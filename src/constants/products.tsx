        {/* Section 1: Firebase Authentication & Protected Routes */}
        <h3>1. Integrating Firebase Authentication with Protected Routes</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Implementing a secure authentication system
          was crucial to ensure that only authorized users could access sensitive
          parts of the application, such as the user dashboard and admin panel.
          Managing authentication state and protecting routes without compromising
          user experience posed a significant challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> I utilized React Router in combination with
          Firebase Authentication. I created a <code>PrivateRoute</code> component
          that checks if a user is authenticated before granting access to
          protected routes. Additionally, I implemented React's Context API to
          manage and provide the authentication state throughout the application.
          By leveraging Firebase's built-in methods for authentication state
          persistence, user sessions could be maintained seamlessly, enhancing
