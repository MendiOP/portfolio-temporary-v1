      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Starting problem-solving in programming contests can be both exhilarating and daunting. To effectively tackle contest problems, it's essential to adopt a structured approach that enhances understanding, optimizes time management, and leverages problem-solving skills. By following a systematic technique and adhering to a well-defined roadmap, participants can improve their ability to dissect problems, devise efficient solutions, and implement them accurately under time constraints. Below is a comprehensive guide outlined in both paragraphs and actionable points to guide you through the problem-solving process in programming contests, along with a roadmap to excel and ace these competitions.

          {/* Understanding the Problem */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Begin by carefully reading the problem statement to grasp the requirements, constraints, and expected outcomes. Identify the input and output formats, and take note of any special conditions or edge cases mentioned. Clarifying doubts early ensures that you address the problem correctly from the outset.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Planning the Solution */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">Planning the Solution</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Once the problem is understood, brainstorm possible approaches or algorithms that can solve it. Consider the time and space complexities to ensure your solution is efficient enough to handle the given constraints. Drawing diagrams or writing pseudocode can help visualize the solution and identify potential pitfalls.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Implementing the Solution */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">Implementing the Solution</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Translate your planned approach into code, ensuring that you follow best coding practices for readability and maintainability. Pay attention to details such as variable naming, code structure, and modularity, which can make debugging easier.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Testing and Debugging */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              After implementation, rigorously test your solution against the provided sample inputs and additional test cases you devise. This helps in verifying the correctness of your code and identifying any logical or syntactical errors. Debug systematically to isolate and fix issues without introducing new bugs.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Optimizing and Refining */}
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">Optimizing and Refining</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If your solution meets the problem requirements but is not optimal, revisit your approach to find ways to enhance its efficiency. Optimization might involve refining algorithms, reducing redundant computations, or utilizing more appropriate data structures.
